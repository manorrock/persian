# Security Policy

## How to get security fixes

Security fixes for customers without a support contract are ONLY applied to the
master branch and delivered as part of the regular release cycle.

If you want a security on an already released version please consider buying a
support contract.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send an email to persian-security-issue@manorrock.com describing the issue
(preferably with a reproducer and/or a fix).
