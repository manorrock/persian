# Security Policy

## How to get security fixes

Security fixes for customers without a support contract are ONLY applied to the
current branch and delivered as part of the regular release cycle.

If you want a security fix on an already released version please consider buying
a support contract. Contact sales@manorrock.com for more information.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send an email to security@manorrock.com describing the issue (preferably
with a reproducer and/or a fix).
